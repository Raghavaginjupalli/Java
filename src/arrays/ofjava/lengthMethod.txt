In Java, length and length() are used to get the size of different types of data structures, but they are not the same.

length:
    > It is used for arrays (1D, 2D, or multidimensional)
    > It is not a method
    > Returns the number of elements in the array.

    int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    System.out.println(arr.length);                 // Output: 5

length() (With Parentheses)
    > It is used for Strings length finding
    > It is a Method (because it has parentheses)
    > Returns the total number of characters in the string (not the array of elements).

    String str = "Hello, World!";
    System.out.println("Length of the string: " + str.length());    // Output: 13

    for String array:
         String [] arr = {"rag", "ramana"};
         System.out.println(arr.length);                 // Output: 2
         System.out.println(arr[0].length() );           // Output: 3  "rag"

         System.out.println(arr[0].length );             // Error.
