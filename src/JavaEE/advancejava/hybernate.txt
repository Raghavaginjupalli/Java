Hibernate:
    Hibernate is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for Java applications.
    It simplifies database interactions by mapping Java objects to relational database tables,
    allowing developers to work with high-level object-oriented concepts instead of direct database queries.


Key Features of Hibernate:

    Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
        Hibernate maps Java classes to database tables and Java data types to SQL data types, bridging the gap between object-oriented programming and relational databases.

    Hibernate Query Language (HQL):
        An object-oriented query language similar to SQL, HQL allows for database-independent queries, facilitating easier database migrations.

    Automatic SQL Generation:
        Hibernate generates SQL queries automatically, reducing the need for manual query writing and minimizing errors.

    Transaction Management:
        It provides comprehensive transaction management, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

    Lazy Loading:
        Hibernate supports lazy loading, fetching related data only when it's actually needed, which can improve performance.

    Caching:
        It includes a caching mechanism to optimize database access and enhance application performance.

Benefits of Using Hibernate:

    Database Independence:
        Hibernate abstracts the database layer, making it easier to switch between different databases without significant code changes.

    Reduced Boilerplate Code:
        By handling repetitive tasks like result set parsing and data conversion, Hibernate allows developers to focus on business logic.

    Improved Productivity:
        With features like automatic table generation and schema validation, Hibernate accelerates development processes.



Features of Hibernate ORM:
    > Hibernate ORM provides its own native API, in addition to full JPA(Java Persistence API) supports.
    > It maps java POJO's (Plain Old java Object) to relational database.
