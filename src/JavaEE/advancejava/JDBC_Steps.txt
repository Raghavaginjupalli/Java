To connect a Java application to a database using JDBC, follow these essential steps:

> Import the JDBC Packages:
    Ensure that your Java program includes the necessary JDBC classes by importing the relevant packages.

    import java.sql.*;


> Register the JDBC Driver:
    Load the JDBC driver specific to your database to enable the application to communicate with it.
    For example, to register the MySQL JDBC driver:

    Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");

    Note: In JDBC 4.0 and later, explicitly registering the driver is optional if the driver's
          JAR file is included in the classpath.


> Establish a Database Connection: Create a connection to the database using the DriverManager class.

    Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(
                                            "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase", "username", "password");

    NOTE: replace with your database's URL, username, and password, respectively.


> Create a Statement Object: Generate a Statement object to execute SQL queries:

    Statement st = con.createStatement();
    PreparedStatement ps = con.PreparedStatement();
    CallableStatement cs = con.CallableStatement();
	
		Security:
			> Statement is more vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
			> PreparedStatement and CallableStatement offer better protection against SQL injection through parameterization.
		
		Use Cases:
			> Use Statement for simple, static SQL queries without parameters.
			> Use PreparedStatement for dynamic queries with parameters, especially when executing the same query multiple times.
			> Use CallableStatement for executing stored procedures and functions in the database.


> Execute SQL Queries: Use the Statement object to run SQL commands. For a SELECT query:

    ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM mytable");

    For INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations:

    int rowsAffected = st.executeUpdate("UPDATE mytable SET column = value WHERE condition");


> Process the Result Set: If executing a SELECT query, iterate through the ResultSet to handle the retrieved data:

    while (rs.next()) {
        String data = resultSet.getString("columnName");
        // Process the data
    }

> Handle Exceptions: Implement proper exception handling to manage potential SQL errors:

    try {
        // JDBC operations
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }


> Close Resources: After completing database operations, close the ResultSet, Statement, and Connection objects to free resources:

    rs.close();
    st.close();
    con.close();

    Note: To close the resources in a finally block or use a try-with-resources statement to ensure they are closed even if an exception occurs.
