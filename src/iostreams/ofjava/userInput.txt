Scanner Methode:
    In Java, the Scanner class is a part of the java.util package, and it is used for reading input from various sources.
    Source types:
        > Keyboard input (System.in)
        > Files
        > Strings
        > Other input streams

    1. Methods for reading different types of input:
            Method	                                    Description

        String:
            nextLine()	                    Reads the entire line as a String.
                # NOTE: It will take & consume the input from keyboard until you press enter keyword.

            next()	                        Reads only one word or one character from input as a String.

        Numeric:
            nextByte()                      Reads the next byte value from the input.
            nextShort()                     Reads the next short value from the input.
            nextInt()	                    Reads the next token as an int.
            nextLong()                      Reads the next long integer from the input.
            nextFloat()                     Reads the next float from the input.
            nextDouble()	                Reads the next token as a double.

        Boolean:
            nextBoolean()                   Reads the next boolean value from the input.
       /*
       NOTE : Other than nextLine(), It will stop reading after giving space and type any character.
       NOTE : If you press enter it will stop taking input from keyboard.

       NOTE : IF you use other than nextLine() line after line, if you give value as a space and character then enter,
              automatically the next methode will consume the previous value after space until another space.
       */


    2. Methods for checking the state of the scanner:
        String:
            hasNext()                       Returns true if there is another token in the input.
            hasNextLine()                   Returns true if there is another line of input.

        Numeric:
            hasNextByte()                   Returns true if the next token can be interpreted as a byte.
            hasNextShort()                  Returns true if the next token can be interpreted as a short.
            hasNextInt()                    Returns true if the next token can be interpreted as an integer.
            hasNextLong()                   Returns true if the next token can be interpreted as a long.
            hasNextFloat()                  Returns true if the next token can be interpreted as a float.
            hasNextDouble()                 Returns true if the next token can be interpreted as a double.

        Boolean:
            hasNextBoolean()                Returns true if the next token can be interpreted as a boolean.

    3. Methods for managing the scanner:
            close(): Closes the scanner and releases any resources associated with it.
            reset(): Resets the scanner to its initial state.
