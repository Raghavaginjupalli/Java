Java:
    > Java SE / J2SE:
        > Java 2 standard edition, it contains java fundamental concepts.
        > by using this we can be able built Standalone Applications.

        Standalone Application:
            If we design and execute any application without using Client-server architecture  or
            without distributing application logic into multiple machines then that is called as Standalone Application.

    Java EE / J2EE:
        > Java 2 enterprise application, it contains server side programing.
        > By using Java EE we can be able to build Enterprise/Distributed applications.

        Enterprise Application/ Client-Server:
            If we design and execute any application on the basis of Client-server architecture  or  distributing
            application logic over multiple machines then that is called as Enterprise Application.

    Java ME / J2ME:
        > Java 2 Micro Edition, we can be able built Mobile application.

        Mobile Application:
            If we design and execute any application on the basis of Mobile H/W system then that is called as Mobile Application.



Java provide Web security By using (JAAS):
    Java authentication & Authorization Service

Distribute Application:
    Java provide distribute application by using J2EE/JAVA EE Module.

Java is Multithreaded:
    Java allows to create and execute more than one thread at a time.
