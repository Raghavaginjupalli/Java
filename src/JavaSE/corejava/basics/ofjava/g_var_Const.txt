Variables & Constants:
    In Java, variables and constants are used to store data in memory during the execution of a program.
    The main difference between them is whether their values can change or remain fixed after being assigned.

    1. Variables
        A variable in Java is a named memory location used to store data. The value of a variable can be changed during the execution of the program.

        Key Points:
            Variables must be declared with a data type, it can be re-assigned to new values.
            It can store different types of data such as all Primitive data types and or Strings.

        > dataType variableName;                      // Declaring a variable

        > variableName = value;                       // Assigning a value to variable

        > dataType variableName = value;              // Declaring and initializing a variable

    2. Constants
        A constant in Java is a variable whose value cannot be changed once assigned.
        Constants are declared using the final keyword.

        Key Points:
            Once a constant is initialized, its value is fixed.
            Constants are written in uppercase letters with underscores (_) to improve readability.
            They are used when you want to ensure the value remains the same throughout the program.

        > final dataType variableName;                      // Declaring a constant

        > variableName = value;                             // Assigning a value to constant

        > final dataType variableName = value;              // Declaring and initializing a constant

    NOTE : Once value assign to constant, we can't re-assign the value.

NOTE: > Variable or Constants are stored in stack if it is a Local scope, otherwise Heep memory because of Global scope.
      > But, String will local or global, it will store the reference variable in Stack and actual data in Heep.
      > Because, String is an object not a Primitive data type.
