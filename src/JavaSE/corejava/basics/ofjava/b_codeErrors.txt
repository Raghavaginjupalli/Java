Code Block Styles:
    > End-of-line style:
        public class Hello {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                System.out.println("Hello, World!");
            }

            public static void main(String[] args)

CODE ERRORS:

    # Compile time Error.
        These errors occur when the code violates Java's language rules.
        Detected by the compiler during compilation.

        Examples:
            Missing semicolon (;).
            Misspelled keywords (e.g., writing publc instead of public).
            Using undeclared variables.
            Top class declared as Private, instead of Public or default.


    # Runtime Errors
        These errors occur while the program is running, after successful compilation.
        Typically caused by invalid operations or data during execution.

        Examples:
            Dividing by zero.
            Accessing an array out of bounds.
            Null pointer exceptions.


    # Logical Errors
        These errors occur when the program runs without crashing but produces incorrect or unintended results.
        Caused by mistakes in the program's logic.
        Not detected by the compiler or during runtime, so debugging is required.

        Example:

            public class Example {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    int a = 5, b = 10;
                    int sum = a - b;                        // Logical error (should be a + b)
                    System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);      // Outputs -5 instead of 15
                }
            }
