Return Type:
    In Java, the return type of method specifies what type of value a method will return to the caller.
    The return type is declared in the method signature before the method name.

    1.Primitive Return Types:
        A method can return any of the Java primitive types, such as byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean.

    2. Reference Return Types:
        Methods can return objects, arrays, or collections as a reference.

    3. Void Return Type:
        The void return type indicates that a method does not return a value.


    Rules:
        > Consistency: The type of the value returned by the method must match the declared return type.
        > Return Statement:
            > For non-void methods, a return statement must exist in all execution paths.
            > For void methods, the return statement is optional and is used to exit the method early.
